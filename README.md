# RECAP Template : R - Small

## Purpose

This repository is a [RECAP](https://recap-org.github.io) template for small-sized academic data projects with R. It is designed to run in cloud IDEs (e.g., GitHub Codespaces) and local IDEs (VS Code, RStudio). Key features:

- A containerized, reproducible software environment that allows running this template on the browser.
- Documentation and tutorials (see the [RECAP](https://recap-org.github.io) site) to help you get started and teach collaborators.

## Getting started

To get started, above the file list, click **Use this template**.

![Use this template button](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-76823/mw-1440/images/help/repository/use-this-template-button.webp)

You have two options: 

### Try it out online

1. Select **Open in a codespace**. 
2. Wait for the codespace to be created and started. **This may take up to 20 minutes.** ☕
3. Once the codespace is ready, you can follow the instructions in the **Basic demo** section below.

### Make your own copy

1. Select **Create a new repository**.
2. Once it is ready, you can: 
    - Open it in GitHub Codespaces by clicking the green **Code** button and selecting **Open with Codespaces > New codespace**.
    - Clone it to your local machine use it locally. You can use the provided containerized environment for a one-click install of all the dependencies (documentation for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and for Positron)

## Demo

First, install the R packages used in this template. Open a terminal and type:

```bash
Rscript -e "install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'modelsummary'))"
```

Open `./src/main.qmd` and hit the Preview button (top right corner) or press `Cmd + Shift + K` to compile the report. You should see a pdf report with some basic data analysis and a photo in `./bin/src/main.pdf`.

## Using this template

This template is organized as follows

```bash
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── assets # where images, latex bibliography and other static assets live (committed to git)
├── data # raw data goes here (committed to git)
├── src
│   ├── main.qmd # generate the final report
│   └── lib # helper functions
├── bin # where your generated report is stored (not committed to git)
├── _quarto.yaml # configuration for Quarto
└── .lintr # configuration for R linting
```

#### Producing the report

The file `./src/main.qmd` produces the final report. It generates a pdf at `./bin/src/main.pdf`.

### External assets

A project may also use assets that are not generated by code (e.g., external images ...). These should be placed in `./assets` and committed to git. 

### Helper functions

Helper functions are shared across your data and analysis code. They are declared in `.R` files that are placed in `./src/lib`. Think of these helper functions as a quasi-R package that accompanies the project. As such, each of these functions should be properly documented so that all collaborators understand how they work.  

### Configuration

Look into the following files to tweak things as you see fit: 

- `./.lintr`: R linting options
- `./_quarto.yaml`: Quarto options
